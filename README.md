# BMI_Calculator
A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool that helps determine if a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on their weight and height. It calculates BMI by dividing a 
person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. This metric is widely used to assess general health and guide lifestyle and medical decisions.

# Description
In this project, I used Android Studio as the development platform and Java as the primary programming language to create a BMI calculator application. The user interface was designed using XML, 
enabling a clean and responsive layout for inputting weight and height. The application calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's inputs and provides an interpretation of the results, 
helping users understand their health status.
